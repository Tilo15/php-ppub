# php-ppub
*Portable PUBlications for PHP*

This is a simple blog engine using PPUB and PPIX formats that started with [PyPPUB](https://github.com/Tilo15/PyPPUB). It is minimalistic but configurable. It makes use of [Vanilla CSS](https://vanillacss.com/) and generates some very simple and standards compliant HTML.

It can show an index based on a raw folder of ppub files, or it can be configured to use a PPIX index file to enable tags and searching.

TODO: add support for licence-label in PPUB metadata. Update RSS feed template to use poster image if applicable
